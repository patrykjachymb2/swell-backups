  "description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<!-- split -->\n<p class=\"lead\">With a cruciform acrylic base that supports a square glass top, the inherent transparency of Bodil Kj√¶r's midcentury table sits lightly in a room. The design comes from her Elements of Architecture series developed from 1955 to 1963 while she first lived in the U.S. near Boston. One of the pioneering women in design, Bodil eventually returned to her native Denmark, where her epochal piece has now been reintroduced by Copenhagen brand Karakter.</p>\n<!-- split -->\n<h2>Specifications</h2>\n<!-- split -->\n<h4>Size</h4>\n<p>13.8\" h x 33.9\" w x 33.9\" d (35x86x86cm)</p>\n<h4>Material</h4>\n<p>Glass, acrylic</p>",

  "description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<!-- split -->\n<p class=\"lead\">Børge Mogensen, known in Denmark as \"the people’s designer\" originally created his outdoor chair with a reclining wood frame for his own own balcony in the late 1960s. The foldable seating provides hours of relaxation and then is easily stored when not in use. Made for maximum durability from FSC-certified teak, the strong wood's natural finish will patinate over time to a mellow grey-blue. A corresponding optional loose cushion in weatherproof Sunbrella fabric ups the comfort level.</p>\n<!-- split -->\n<h2>Specifications</h2>\n<!-- split -->\n<h4>Size</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>35\" h x 23.8\" w x 53.1\" d (89x60.5x135cm)</li>\n<li>Armrest height: 21.5\" (54.5cm)</li>\n<li>Cushion: 19.1\" h x 66.5\" w x 3.1\" d (48.5x169x8cm)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Material</h4>\n<p>Teak, papyrus, foam, stainless steel</p>\n<h4>Details</h4>\n<p>Cushion only comes in Heritage Papyrus 18006</p>",

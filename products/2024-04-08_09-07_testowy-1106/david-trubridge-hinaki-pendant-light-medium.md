  "description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<!-- split -->\n<p class=\"lead\">The first lamp New Zealand designer David Trubridge ever made in 1995 was shaped like a hinaki, the eel traps the Maori make from woven vines. The elongated form of the Hinaki Pendant Light equally captures attention in a foyer or room. <br><br>A passion for the environment and earth drives the construction of all David's work, primarily made of renewable bamboo and flat-packed to reduce freighting and packaging resources and the identical pieces make home assembly a snap, literally. Endlessly adaptable, the light is available in 2 sizes and 9 stock colors (custom colors upon request) in natural or painted bamboo with nylon clip fasteners. The celebrated designing craftsman ended up in his adopted home of New Zealand after he, his wife and their two sons sold everything and set off on a yacht for a world adventure. It culminated in 1985 when they decided to remain there. While an artist-in-residence, he built a house and suddenly found himself with further commissions. Before realizing homes, lamps and furniture, David left Newcastle University in 1972 with a degree in Naval architecture. His work has appeared in countless museums, including the Victoria &amp; Albert and the Pompidou Centre. That barely scratches the surface of his fascinating story and work ethos.</p>\n<!-- split -->\n<h2>Specifications</h2>\n<!-- split -->\n<h4>Size</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>35.4\" h x 12.6\" d (90x32cm)</li>\n<li>Cord length: 78.7\" (200cm)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Material</h4>\n<p>Bamboo plywood, nylon</p>\n<h4>Technical</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>UL listed</li>\n<li>E26</li>\n<li>Bulb not included</li>\n</ul>",

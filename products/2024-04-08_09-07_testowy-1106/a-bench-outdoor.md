  "description": "<h2>DescriptionÂ </h2>\n<!-- split -->\n<p>A-Bench by London designer Felix de Pass has a uniquely angled seat expressly shaped to accommodate the function of sitting comfortably, with a similar folded-metal structure for the legs. Originally conceived as an interior piece with the seat in oiled larch wood and powder-coated legs in dark grey, it was subsequently retooled in an additional version for outdoor use. The weather-resistant design features a perforated steel surface to allow water to drain and a sulfur yellow industrial powder-coating not ordinarily used in furniture production.</p>\n<!-- split -->\n<h2>Specifications</h2>\n<!-- split -->\n<h4>Size</h4>\n<p>17.7\" h x 70.9\" w x 16.5\" d (44.9x180x41.9cm)</p>\n<h4>Material</h4>\n<p>Powder coated perforated mild steel, rubber</p>",

  "description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<!-- split -->\n<p class=\"lead\">The harakeke, also known as flax, is a New Zealand indigenous plant prized for its valuable fiber. As the Maori proverb goes, \"If you cut the central stalk of the flax bush, where will the bellbird feed?\" Designer David Trubridge celebrates that aphorism with his Flax Pendant Light, inspired by the plant's spreading leaves. A love for earth drove the construction: it's made of renewable bamboo and flat-packed to reduce freighting and packaging resources and the identical pieces make home assembly a snap, literally. Endlessly adaptable, the light is available in 2 sizes and 9 stock colors (custom colors upon request) in natural or painted bamboo with nylon clip fasteners. <br><br>The celebrated designing craftsman ended up in his adopted home of New Zealand after he, his wife and their 2 sons sold everything and set off sailing on a world adventure. Their voyage culminated years later in 1985 when they decided to remain in New Zealand. While an artist-in-residence, David built a house and suddenly found himself with further commissions. Before realizing homes, lamps and furniture, he left Newcastle University in 1972 with a degree in Naval architecture. His work has appeared in countless museums, including the Victoria &amp; Albert and the Pompidou Centre. And that barely scratches the surface of his fascinating story and work ethos.</p>\n<!-- split -->\n<h2>Specifications</h2>\n<!-- split -->\n<h4>Size</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>8.7\" h x 31.5\" dia (22x80cm)</li>\n<li>Cord length: 78.7\" (200cm)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Material</h4>\n<p>Bamboo plywood, nylon</p>\n<h4>Technical</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>UL listed</li>\n<li>E26</li>\n<li>Bulb not included</li>\n</ul>",

  "description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<!-- split -->\n<p class=\"lead\">Bold color and the distinct geometric pattern dubbed \"Lucy\" by Bend designer Gaurav Nanda are only a couple of reasons to love these stools. Inside or out, at a kitchen counter or poolside bar, they are also remarkably durable and comfortable. <br><br>Unlike most wire chairs on the market, Bend chairs are a pleasure to sit on. Gaurav spaces the wires less than a quarter-inch apart and each piece is machine-molded and undergoes upwards of 400 handmade spot-welds—a process he refers to as \"bending.\" Each bend is carefully arranged to ensure structural strength, while the angles of the back, the curves of the seat, and the closeness of the wires are designed to encourage relaxation, comfort and utility. Gaurav, who grew up in the Detroit suburbs and even spent part of his design career at General Motors, draws pattern inspiration from his childhood: the intricate macram<span>é</span> his mother made; string art Spirograph drawing sets. (He was also a part of the design and conception of Clocky with his sister Gauri).</p>\n<p class=\"lead\">What's more, the collection is made of an iron that can be repeatedly recycled (something for your green heads), and all pieces are sandblasted, then pre-treated with anti-rust zinc primer and powder coated for extended life right in Gaurav's L.A. studio.</p>\n<!-- split -->\n<h2>Specifications</h2>\n<!-- split -->\n<h4>Size</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bar</li>\n<ul>\n<li>44\" h x 19\" w x 15\" d (111.8x48.3x38.1cm)</li>\n<li>Seat height: 30\" h (76.2cm)</li>\n</ul>\n<li><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Counter</span></li>\n<ul>\n<li>40\" h x 19\" w x 15\" d (101.6x48.3x38.1cm)</li>\n<li>Seat height: 26\" h (66cm)</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<h4>Material</h4>\n<p>Galvanized iron, powder-coated steel</p>\n<h4>Details</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Seat pads provided by Sunbrella™</li>\n<li>Please contact us for information on custom color and fabric orders.</li>\n<li>info@aplusrstore.com</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Technical</h4>\n<p>Slight assembly required</p>\n<h4></h4>",

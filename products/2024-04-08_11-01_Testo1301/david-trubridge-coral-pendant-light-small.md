  "description": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<!-- split -->\n<p class=\"lead\">The \"fingers\" of the geometric polyhedron structure of this lamp are reminiscent of the coral reefs David Trubridge explores off the coast of New Zealand. A love for earth drove the construction, flatpacked to reduce freight and packing resources. Identical pieces make home assembly a snap. The celebrated designing craftsman ended up in his adopted home after he, his wife and their two sons sold everything and set off on a yacht for a world adventure. It culminated in 1985 when they decided to remain there. While an artist-in-residence at Hawkes Bay Polytechnic (now EIT), he built a house and suddenly found himself with further commissions. Before realizing homes, lamps and furniture, David left Newcastle University in 1972 with a degree in Naval architecture. His work has appeared in countless museums, including the Victoria &amp; Albert and the Pompidou Centre. That barely scratches the surface of his fascinating story and work ethos.</p>\n<!-- split -->\n<h2>Specifications</h2>\n<!-- split -->\n<h4>Size</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>23.6\" dia (60cm)</li>\n<li>Cord length: 78.7\" (200cm)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Material</h4>\n<p>Bamboo p<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">lywood</span>, nylon</p>\n<h4>Technical</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>UL listed</li>\n<li>E26</li>\n<li>Bulb not included</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Details</h4>\n<p>Black nylon clips are for black exteriors, andÂ all other exterior colors come with white nylon clips.</p>",
